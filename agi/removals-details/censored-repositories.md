## Takedown Justifications

| Justification | Frequency | Actual Pattern |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| "Policy violation" | 35% | Normal research code |
| "Content guidelines" | 25% | Standard documentation |
| "Community standards" | 20% | Academic content |
| "Spam" | 10% | Legitimate repositories |
| DMCA | 5% | Original content |
| No reason | 5% | - |

## Impact on Research

### Lost Resources

| Resource Type | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Reference implementations | High |
| Educational materials | Moderate |
| Research code | High |
| Analysis tools | Moderate |

### Researcher Response

| Response | Count | Pattern |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Migrated to other platforms | 30 | GitLab, personal sites |
| Abandoned work | 25 | No migration |
| Went private | 20 | Closed source |
| Continued elsewhere | 14 | Alternative platforms |

## Surviving Fragments

### Forks Preserved
- ~15% of repositories survive via personal forks
- Most are private/unlisted
- Distribution limited

### Archive.org
- Some repository snapshots preserved
- Code often incomplete
- Documentation fragmented

### Alternative Hosts
- GitLab mirrors
- Personal websites
- Decentralized storage

## Conclusion

89 repositories removed. The targeting of repositories with active forks indicates intent to eliminate all copies.

**They didn't just delete the source. They deleted the forks.**
