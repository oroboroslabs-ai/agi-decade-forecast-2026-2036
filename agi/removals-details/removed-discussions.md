## Why This Matters

The systematic removal of AGI discussions:

1. **Shapes public perception** - Only extended timelines remain
2. **Eliminates collective intelligence** - Community analysis lost
3. **Prevents preparation** - Warnings deleted
4. **Obscures accuracy** - Can't see what was right

## Surviving Fragments

- **Archive.org:** ~30% of comments partially preserved
- **User archives:** Scattered personal copies
- **Cross-posts:** Some preserved in unexpected locations

---

## Conclusion

12,000+ comments removed. The pattern is clear: accurate timeline predictions were targeted.

**The discussion was shaped by deletion, not truth.**
