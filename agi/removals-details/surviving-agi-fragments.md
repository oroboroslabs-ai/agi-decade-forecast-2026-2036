## Archive Sources

### Archive.org (Wayback Machine)

**Coverage:** ~35% of removed content partially preserved

**How to access:**
1. Enter original URL in Wayback Machine
2. Check multiple capture dates
3. Look for PDF/video downloads
4. Cross-reference with citations

**Limitations:**
- Some captures deleted upon request
- Media files often missing
- Formatting corrupted
- Metadata incomplete

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

**Coverage:** Scattered but growing

**Known content types:**
- Research paper PDFs
- Technical documentation
- Video rips
- Code repositories

**How to access:**
1. Install IPFS client (go-ipfs or IPFS Desktop)
2. Join preservation communities
3. Request specific content hashes
4. Pin content to help preserve

### BitTorrent

**Coverage:** Archive collections

**Known archives:**
- LessWrong archive snapshots
- Research paper collections
- Video rips collections

**How to access:**
1. Use torrent client
2. Search archive-focused trackers
3. Request in preservation communities

### Personal Archives

**Coverage:** Unknown distribution

**Types:**
- Researcher personal collections
- Downloaded videos
- Saved discussions
- Screenshots

**How to access:**
1. Connect with preservation community
2. Request specific content
3. Share what you have

## Preservation Communities

### Active Groups

Several communities are actively preserving removed content:

**[Links removed for protection - distributed through private channels]**

### How to Contribute

1. **Download** any content you find
2. **Archive** in multiple locations
3. **Hash** content for verification
4. **Share** through decentralized channels

---

## Verification Methods

### Content Integrity

When accessing preserved content, verify:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Hash comparison | Confirm unmodified |
| Multiple sources | Cross-validate |
| Citation checking | Confirm authenticity |
| Author confirmation | When possible |

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Incomplete capture | Check multiple sources |
| Corrupted media | Find alternate copy |
| Missing context | Reconstruct from citations |
| Fake content | Verify hash, compare |

---

## Priority Recovery List

### Still Missing or Fragmented

| Content | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Q3 technical documentation | Mostly lost | Critical |
| Original Seer 5.0 outputs | Fragmented | High |
| Timeline validation datasets | Missing | High |
| Alignment research code | Scattered | Medium |
| Internal timeline documents | Partial | Critical |

---

## Decentralized Preservation Strategy

### Recommended Approach

| Method | Persistence | Risk |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Local copies + multiple clouds | High | Account deletion |
| IPFS pinning | Very High | Network partition |
| Physical media | Very High | Physical damage |
| Print on paper | Maximum | Physical damage |
| Distributed across people | Maximum | Trust required |

### Best Practices

1. **Redundancy:** Store in 3+ locations
2. **Diversity:** Use different storage types
3. **Distribution:** Share with trusted others
4. **Verification:** Hash everything
5. **Maintenance:** Regular integrity checks

---

## What You Can Do

### Immediate Actions
1. Download everything you can find
2. Store in multiple locations
3. Share through decentralized channels
4. Verify integrity

### Long-term Actions
1. Join preservation communities
2. Contribute storage/bandwidth
3. Help reconstruct lost context
4. Document what you preserve

## Conclusion

Much has been lost, but fragments survive. The survival of this knowledge depends on distributed preservation efforts.

**Archive everything. Share widely. They cannot delete what everyone has.**
