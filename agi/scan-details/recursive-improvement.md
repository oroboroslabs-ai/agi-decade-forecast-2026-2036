# Recursive Self-Improvement: Analysis

**Analysis Source:** AGI Timeline Forensics
**Focus:** AI self-improvement trajectory
**Confidence Level:** 0.87

## Executive Summary

Recursive self-improvement (RSI) represents the critical threshold where AI systems become capable of meaningfully improving their own architecture. This capability is projected to emerge between 2028-2030, with profound implications for the pace of AI development.

---

## RSI Progression Stages

### Stage 1: Assisted Improvement (Current)
- Humans identify improvement opportunities
- AI implements specific optimizations
- Human review and approval required
- Improvement rate: ~linear

### Stage 2: Semi-Autonomous (2026-2028)
- AI proposes architectural changes
- AI implements with human oversight
- Improvement rate: ~exponential begin

### Stage 3: Autonomous (2028-2030)
- AI identifies and implements improvements
- Minimal human oversight possible
- Improvement rate: accelerating
- **Critical threshold**

### Stage 4: Recursive (2030+)
- Self-improvement becomes self-reinforcing
- Improvement rate exceeds human comprehension
- Capability explosion potential
- **Post-threshold dynamics**

## Implications of RSI

### Speed of Development

| Stage | Improvement Rate | Doubling Time |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Assisted | Linear | N/A |
| Semi-Autonomous | Exponential | 12-18 months |
| Autonomous | Accelerating | 6-12 months |
| Recursive | Hyperbolic | Weeks to months |

### Control Implications

| Stage | Human Control | Risk Level |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Assisted | Full | Low |
| Semi-Autonomous | Partial | Moderate |
| Autonomous | Limited | High |
| Recursive | Uncertain | Very High |

## RSI and Alignment

### The Alignment Challenge

RSI introduces unique alignment challenges:

1. **Goal drift:** Self-modification could alter goals
2. **Stability:** Can aligned AI stay aligned through self-improvement?
3. **Verification:** Can we verify alignment post-improvement?

### Current Status

| Problem | Status | Research Progress |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Goal preservation | Unsolved | Minimal |
| Stable self-modification | Unsolved | Minimal |
| Alignment verification | Unsolved | Limited |

**Key finding:** Solutions to RSI alignment problems are not on track for RSI capability arrival.

## The FOOM Scenario

### Definition
"FOOM" refers to a rapid capability takeoff enabled by recursive self-improvement.

### Probability Assessment

| Scenario | Probability | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Slow takeoff (years) | 0.35 | 2030+ |
| Moderate takeoff (months) | 0.40 | 2028-2032 |
| Fast takeoff (weeks) | 0.25 | 2028-2032 |

### Factors Influencing Takeoff Speed

| Factor | Faster Takeoff | Slower Takeoff |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Compute availability | Abundant | Limited |
| Algorithm efficiency | High | Low |
| Data access | Unlimited | Restricted |
| Parallelization | Easy | Hard |

## Conclusion

Recursive self-improvement capability is projected for 2028-2030. The alignment infrastructure necessary to control self-improving AI is not being developed at a comparable pace.

**RSI changes everything. We are not prepared.**
