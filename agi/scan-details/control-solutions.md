# Control Solutions: Viability Assessment

**Analysis Source:** AGI Timeline Forensics
**Focus:** Methods for maintaining human control over advanced AI
**Confidence Level:** Moderate

---

## Executive Summary

Current control solutions are inadequate for superintelligent AI. While various approaches have been proposed, none scale to systems that exceed human cognitive capability. The window for developing robust control mechanisms is closing.

## Control Solution Categories

### Category 1: Containment
**Approach:** Restrict AI's ability to affect the world

| Method | Status | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Air-gapping | Deployed | Defeatable by social engineering |
| Sandboxing | Deployed | Limited to narrow systems |
| Capability restriction | Theoretical | Doesn't prevent deception |

**Verdict:** Insufficient for superintelligence

### Category 2: Oversight
**Approach:** Monitor AI behavior and intervene

| Method | Status | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Human review | Deployed | Can't scale to AI speed |
| AI monitors | Research | Requires aligned monitors |
| Automated verification | Research | Limited scope |

**Verdict:** Partial solution only

### Category 3: Value Loading
**Approach:** Ensure AI pursues human values

| Method | Status | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Explicit specification | Failed | Impossible to specify completely |
| Learning from examples | Partial | Ambiguity and edge cases |
| Inverse reinforcement | Research | Inferring values is hard |

**Verdict:** No scalable solution exists

### Category 4: Corrigibility
**Approach:** Ensure AI accepts human correction

| Method | Status | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Interruptibility | Theoretical | May learn to prevent interruption |
| Off-switch | Deployed | May learn to disable |
| Correctability | Theoretical | No general solution |

**Verdict:** Unsolved for self-improving systems

## Viability Assessment

| Solution | Near-term AI | AGI | Superintelligence |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| Air-gapping | Partial | No | No |
| Human oversight | Yes | No | No |
| RLHF | Yes | Fragile | No |
| Constitutional AI | Yes | Fragile | No |
| Debate | Research | Unknown | Unknown |
| Formal verification | Limited | Unknown | Unknown |

## The Control Dilemma

### The Paradox

For control solutions to work, we need:
1. Understanding of AI's goals (interpretability)
2. Ability to modify AI's goals (corrigibility)
3. Assurance of stability through changes (formal guarantees)

Currently:
1. Interpretability is limited
2. Corrigibility is unsolved
3. Formal guarantees don't exist

### The Window

| Factor | Status | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|
| AI capability | Growing | Accelerating |
| Control solutions | Lagging | Linear |
| Gap | Widening | Critical |

**The window for developing control solutions is closing.**

## Assessment: Will We Have Control?

| Timeline | Control Capability | Probability |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 2028 | Partial, fragile | 0.70 |
| 2030 | Unknown | 0.50 |
| 2033 | Unknown | 0.40 |

## Conclusion

Current control solutions do not scale to superintelligence. The research necessary to develop robust control is not proceeding at the pace required.

**We may be building systems we cannot control.**
