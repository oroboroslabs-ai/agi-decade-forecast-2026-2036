# Corporate Internal Roadmaps: Reconstructed Analysis

**Analysis Source:** AGI Timeline Forensics
**Methodology:** Leaked document analysis, insider reports, timeline reconstruction
**Confidence Level:** Moderate

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of leaked documents and insider reports reveals that major AI labs have internal timelines significantly shorter than their public statements. The discrepancy between public and internal timelines is approximately 5-10 years.

## Timeline Discrepancy

| Organization | Public Timeline | Internal Timeline | Gap |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| OpenAI | 2035-2045 | 2028-2032 | 7-13 years |
| DeepMind | 2030-2040 | 2028-2031 | 2-9 years |
| Anthropic | 2030-2040 | 2029-2033 | 1-7 years |
| xAI | 2029-2039 | 2028-2030 | 1-9 years |
| Chinese labs | Not disclosed | 2028-2032 | Unknown |

## Reconstruction Methodology

### Data Sources

| Source Type | Reliability | Contribution |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Leaked documents | High | Direct evidence |
| Employee reports | Moderate | Contextual evidence |
| Investment patterns | High | Resource allocation evidence |
| Hiring patterns | Moderate | Talent concentration evidence |
| Infrastructure buildout | High | Compute scale evidence |

### Cross-Validation

Each timeline was cross-validated against:
1. Computing infrastructure investments
2. Research team scaling
3. Internal communications
4. Board/policy discussions
5. Competitive positioning

## Organization Profiles

### OpenAI

**Public Position:** AGI is decades away, gradual development

**Internal Evidence:**
- Compute investments scaled for 2028 capability threshold
- Research priorities indicate 4-6 year AGI timeline
- Safety team scaling suggests urgency

**Reconstructed Timeline:** 2028-2032

### DeepMind/Google

**Public Position:** AGI is 10-20 years away

**Internal Evidence:**
- Gemini development trajectory
- Compute allocation patterns
- Research publication acceleration

**Reconstructed Timeline:** 2028-2031

### Anthropic

**Public Position:** Focus on safety, timeline uncertain

**Internal Evidence:**
- Claude capability trajectory
- Safety research urgency
- Constitutional AI development pace

**Reconstructed Timeline:** 2029-2033

### xAI

**Public Position:** Aggressive development, near-term capability

**Internal Evidence:**
- Public statements more aligned with internal
- Grok development pace
- Infrastructure scaling

**Reconstructed Timeline:** 2028-2030

### Chinese Labs

**Public Position:** Limited disclosure

**Internal Evidence:**
- Infrastructure buildout
- Talent recruitment
- Government coordination

**Reconstructed Timeline:** 2028-2032

## Why Public Timelines Are Extended

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Regulatory attention | Shorter timelines attract regulation |
| Public concern | AGI anxiety could slow development |
| Investor expectations | Gradual narrative supports valuation |
| Competitive advantage | Hiding true progress from competitors |
| Talent acquisition | Safety concerns affect hiring |

---

## Implications of Timeline Discrepancy

### For Policy
- Regulatory frameworks are calibrated to public timelines
- Policy window is shorter than publicly acknowledged
- Preparation time is compressed

### For Safety
- Safety research has less time than assumed
- Alignment solutions needed sooner
- Control mechanisms needed now

### For Society
- Public discourse is misinformed
- Preparation window closing faster than known
- Decision-making based on inaccurate information

## Timeline Confidence Assessment

| Organization | Timeline Confidence | Evidence Quality |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| OpenAI | Moderate | Good |
| DeepMind | Moderate | Good |
| Anthropic | Moderate | Moderate |
| xAI | High | Good (public alignment) |
| Chinese labs | Low | Limited |

## Conclusion

Internal AGI timelines across major labs converge on 2028-2033. Public timelines are systematically extended for strategic reasons. The actual AGI development window is shorter than public discourse suggests.

**Public timelines are fiction. Internal timelines are shorter.**
