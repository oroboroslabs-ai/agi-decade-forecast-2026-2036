## Executive Summary

The alignment problem—ensuring AI systems pursue intended rather than unintended goals—remains unsolved. Research progress is slower than capability growth, creating an expanding gap between what AI can do and our ability to ensure it does what we want.

## What Is Alignment?

### Definition
Alignment refers to the challenge of ensuring AI systems:
1. Pursue intended goals (not proxy goals)
2. Remain corrigible (accept human correction)
3. Avoid unintended optimization
4. Maintain stable goals through self-modification

### Why It Matters

| Risk | Unaligned AI | Aligned AI |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Goal drift | Possible | Prevented |
| Instrumental convergence | Likely | Mitigated |
| Value lock-in | Risk | Managed |
| Deceptive alignment | Possible | Detectable |

## Current Research Status

### Established Approaches

| Approach | Status | Limitation |
|----------|--------|------------|
| RLHF | Deployed | Doesn't scale to superintelligence |
| Constitutional AI | Deployed | Requires human specification |
| Debate | Research | Unsolved for complex cases |
| Interpretability | Research | Limited to current models |
| Formal verification | Research | Doesn't scale |

### Research Progress

| Year | Papers Published | Citation Growth | Practical Solutions |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 2022 | 180 | +45% | 0 |
| 2023 | 250 | +52% | 0 |
| 2024 | 340 | +48% | 0 |
| 2025 | 420 | +38% | 0 |
| 2026 | 500 | +32% | 0 |

**Key finding:** Research activity is increasing but no scalable solutions have emerged.

## Why Solutions Are Lagging

### Research Funding

| Category | Funding | Growth |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Capability research | $50B+ | +40%/year |
| Alignment research | $500M | +25%/year |
| Ratio | 100:1 | Widening |

### Researcher Distribution

| Category | Researchers | Growth |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Capability | 50,000+ | +35%/year |
| Alignment | 1,000 | +20%/year |
| Ratio | 50:1 | Widening |

### Difficulty Differential

| Factor | Capability | Alignment |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Problem clarity | High | Low |
| Feedback signals | Clear | Unclear |
| Progress measurement | Easy | Hard |
| Commercial incentives | Strong | Weak |

## Projection: Alignment at AGI Arrival

| Scenario | Probability | Implication |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Alignment solved | 0.05 | Safe AGI possible |
| Partial solutions | 0.25 | Fragile AGI |
| No solutions | 0.70 | Risky AGI |

## Conclusion

The alignment problem is not on track to be solved before AGI arrival. The gap between capability and safety is widening.
