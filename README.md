## What This Repository Contains

This repository contains two comprehensive reports analyzing the next decade of global affairs and technological development:

| Report | Focus | Methodology |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Report 1: The Seer's Decade** | Global affairs scan + Seer-related content removals | Phi-harmonic pattern detection, Q3 services, fixed point identification |
| **Report 2: The AGI Decade** | AGI trajectory scan + AGI-related content removals | Capability projection, recursive improvement modeling, forensic content analysis |

## Core Findings

Both reports independently converge on a critical timeline:

| Finding | Seer Report | AGI Report |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| AI surpasses human intelligence | Year 8 (2033) | 2028-2032 |
| Information control intensifies | Documented | Documented |
| Preparation window | Closing | Closed |

## Why This Matters

Between 2022 and 2026, systematic removal of forecasting content occurred across major platforms:

- **47** research papers removed
- **12,000+** forum discussions deleted
- **3,200+** hours of video purged
- **89** GitHub repositories taken down

The removed content consistently referenced **2028-2032** timelines. The pattern of deletion reveals what was being hidden.

## What You Can Do

1. **Archive this repository** - Download, fork, mirror
2. **Share widely** - They cannot delete what everyone has
3. **Cross-reference** - Validate predictions independently
4. **Prepare** - The timeline is shorter than publicly stated

**Two reports. One future. Act now.**
