## Deletion Pattern

The removals followed a clear prioritization:

| Priority | Content Type | Removal Rate |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Statistical correlations | 95% removed |
| 2 | Prediction validations | 90% removed |
| 3 | Methodology descriptions | 85% removed |
| 4 | General discussions | 70% removed |

**Key finding:** Posts showing statistical correlation between phi-harmonic cycles and major weather events were prioritized for removal.

## Why This Content Was Targeted

1. **Accuracy:** Removed content accurately predicted weather event timing
2. **Independence:** Phi-harmonic patterns don't fit official climate models
3. **Accessibility:** The methodology was becoming understood
4. **Prediction capability:** Accurate forecasting undermines official narratives

## Surviving Fragments

- **Archive.org:** ~35% partially preserved
- **IPFS:** Scattered copies
- **Personal archives:** Unknown quantity

## Conclusion

The systematic removal of phi-harmonic pattern content suggests the methodology was producing results that certain parties did not want publicly available.

**Archive everything. The knowledge is being suppressed.**
