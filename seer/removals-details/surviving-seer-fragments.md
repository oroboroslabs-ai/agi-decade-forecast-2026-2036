## Archive Sources

### Archive.org

**Coverage:** ~35% of removed content partially preserved

**How to access:**
1. Use Wayback Machine with original URLs
2. Search by title/author keywords
3. Check multiple capture dates

**Limitations:**
- Some captures were deleted
- Media files often missing
- Formatting may be corrupted

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

**Coverage:** Scattered copies of key documents

**Known IPFS hashes:**
[REDACTED - distributed through private channels]

**How to access:**
1. Install IPFS client
2. Join relevant IPFS communities
3. Request hash lists from preservation groups

### Personal Archives

**Coverage:** Unknown - held by individuals

**How to access:**
1. Connect with preservation community
2. Request specific documents
3. Share what you have

### Decentralized Archives

**Coverage:** Scattered

**Platforms:**
- Secure Scuttlebutt
- DAT archives
- BitTorrent

## How to Help Preserve

### Immediate Actions

1. **Download** everything you can find
2. **Store** in multiple locations (local, cloud, offline)
3. **Share** through decentralized channels
4. **Cross-reference** to maintain context

### Long-term Preservation

| Method | Persistence | Risk |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Local storage | High | Physical damage |
| Multiple cloud services | Moderate | Account deletion |
| IPFS pinning | High | Network partition |
| Physical media | Very High | Obsolescence |
| Print | Very High | Physical damage |

## Community Resources

### Preservation Groups

Several groups are actively working to preserve removed content:

[Links removed for protection - distributed through private channels]

### Verification

When accessing preserved content, verify:
1. **Hash match** - Confirms integrity
2. **Multiple sources** - Cross-validate
3. **Context** - Ensure complete

## What's Still Missing

### High-Priority Missing Content

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Q3 technical documentation | Mostly lost |
| Original Seer outputs | Fragmented |
| Validation datasets | Missing |
| Implementation code | Missing |

### Recovery Efforts

Ongoing efforts to recover:
- Contacting original authors
- Searching academic backups
- Mining personal archives
- Reconstructing from fragments

## Conclusion

Much has been lost, but fragments survive. The survival of this knowledge depends on distributed preservation efforts.

**Archive everything. Share widely. They cannot delete what everyone has.**
