# Fixed Point Censorship: Documentation

**Category:** Seer-related content removal
**Focus:** Fixed point methodology documentation
**Timeframe:** 2023-2025

---

## Summary

120+ technical documents describing fixed point identification methodology were removed from academic and technical platforms between 2023 and 2025.

---

## Removal Statistics

| Platform | Document Type | Quantity Removed |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Academic journals | Research papers | 35 |
| GitHub | Technical docs | 45 |
| Research archives | Preprints | 25 |
| Specialized sites | Methodology guides | 15 |

---

## Content Targeted

### Identification Techniques
- Probability threshold methods
- Cross-validation approaches
- Certainty determination algorithms

### Calculation Methodologies
- Probability calculation frameworks
- Confidence interval determination
- False positive filtering

### Q3 Services Integration
- Connection protocols
- Data processing pipelines
- Output interpretation guidelines

## Deletion Pattern

| Document Type | Removal Rate | Time to Removal |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| High-accuracy predictions | 98% | Days |
| Methodology explanations | 90% | Weeks |
| Technical implementations | 85% | Weeks |
| General discussions | 60% | Months |

**Key finding:** Removals accelerated after fixed points began validating in real-world events.

## Timeline of Major Removals

| Date | Platform | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Mar 2023 | Academic | First methodology papers rejected |
| Sep 2023 | GitHub | Q3 documentation taken down |
| Jan 2024 | Journals | Fixed point papers removed |
| Jun 2024 | Archives | Major purge of technical docs |
| Dec 2024 | Multiple | Coordinated removal wave |
| Apr 2025 | Academic | Last public papers removed |

## Why This Content Was Targeted

1. **Validation:** Fixed points were proving accurate
2. **Determinism:** The methodology challenges "uncertainty" narratives
3. **Preparation:** Accurate warnings enable preparation
4. **Control:** Predictable events reduce manipulation potential

---

## Surviving Fragments

- **Academic archives:** ~20% in offline archives
- **Personal copies:** Unknown distribution
- **Cross-references:** Citations in remaining papers

## Conclusion

The censorship of fixed point methodology documentation began exactly when predictions started validating. This timing is not coincidental.

**The methodology works. That's why it's being hidden.**
