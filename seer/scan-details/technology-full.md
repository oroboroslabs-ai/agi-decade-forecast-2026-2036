## Post-Quantum Cryptography

Current encryption standards will become obsolete when quantum computing reaches practical decryption capability in Year 9.

### Migration Timeline

| Phase | Year | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Audit | 0-2 | Identify all encrypted data |
| Plan | 2-4 | Select quantum-resistant algorithms |
| Migrate | 4-7 | Implement new encryption |
| Complete | 7-9 | Full migration before quantum viable |
| Assume compromise | 9+ | All pre-migration data vulnerable |

### Encryption Vulnerability

| Data Type | Risk Level | Priority |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Stored communications | Critical | Immediate |
| Financial records | Critical | Immediate |
| Healthcare data | High | Year 0-3 |
| Government secrets | Critical | Immediate |
| Personal data | High | Year 0-5 |

## AI Governance Requirements

### Immediate Actions

| Priority | Action | Deadline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | International ethics frameworks | Year 5 |
| 2 | Alignment research acceleration | Year 8 |
| 3 | Control mechanism development | Year 8 |
| 4 | Societal preparation | Year 7 |

### The Alignment Gap

| Year | Capability Level | Alignment Status |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0 | Domain-specific | Partial |
| 3 | Broad | Lagging |
| 5 | Near-general | Insufficient |
| 8 | General | Unknown |

**Critical finding:** Alignment research is not keeping pace with capability growth.

## Convergence with AGI Report

The Seer's Year 8 AI surpasses human intelligence aligns with the AGI Report's 2028-2033 timeline.

| Source | Prediction | Confidence |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Seer | Year 8 (2033) | 0.85 |
| AGI Report | 2028-2033 | 0.82 |
| **Convergence** | **2028-2033** | **High** |

## Preparation Actions

### Immediate (Years 0-3)
- Begin post-quantum cryptography migration
- Support AI ethics framework development
- Audit all encrypted data

### Medium-term (Years 3-6)
- Complete quantum-resistant encryption
- Establish AI governance structures
- Monitor capability thresholds

### Long-term (Years 6-10)
- Assume AI capability acceleration
- Assume encryption vulnerability
- Maintain operational security
